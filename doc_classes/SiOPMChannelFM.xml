		Frequency modulation channel implementation.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		This implementation is based on OPM emulation, referenced from sources of mame, fmgen, and x68sound.
		It also introduces a few extensions to simulate several other FM sound modules (OPNA, OPLL, OPL2, OPL3, OPX, MA-3, MA-5, MA-7, TSS, and DX7), including:
		- stereo output (from TSS, DX7)[br]- key scale level (from OPL3, OPX, MA-x)[br]- phase selection (from TSS)[br]- fixed frequency (from MA-x)[br]- SSG envelope control (from OPNA)[br]- wave shape selection (from OPX, MA-x, TSS)[br]- custom wave shapes (from MA-x)[br]- more supported algorithms (from OPLx, OPX, MA-x, DX7)[br]- decimal multiple (from p-TSS)[br]- feedback from operators 1-3 (from DX7)[br]- channel independent LFO (from TSS)[br]- low-pass filter envelope (from MA-x)[br]- flexible FM connections (from TSS)[br]- ring modulation (from C64?)
