		When the [method SiONDriver.play] method is called with an MML string, this container is created implicitly by parsing the provided string. It can also be created by hand and supplied to the [method SiONDriver.play] method.
		When creating by hand, make sure to carefully and correctly craft the event sequence (or sequences). Refer to [method MMLData.get_global_sequence] and [method MMLData.get_sequence_group].
